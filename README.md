# Pandas

The dataset present a list of messages recieved from some random source and they have been classified as either spam or ham based on the message that they contain.

# What has been performed??

This work is just for fun. I have just counted the number of ham and spam messages present in the data and then plotted a bar graph to compare which is more, in this case it was ham.

Also I have done some coding to find the longest message among all the messages given in the dataset. This may be used to segregate the message with detailed explanation with the one that are crisp and concise.
